# SafeDineMTL
A map-based application that informs users of health and safety violations over the last 5 years in restaurants across Montreal, which allows users to make informed choices about the establishments they frequent, and prevent illness and hospitalization from unsanitary conditions (hence the name SafeDineMTL).
